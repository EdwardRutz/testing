Exercise, Nashville Software School


## Overview

- Build unit test coverage for all the functionality of the code in the `animal` module.


## Concepts
- TDD
- MiniTest


## Requirements

Write test cases to verify the I/O of the following methods of `Animal` and `Dog`.
- [X] In the test class' `setup` method, create an instance of `Animal` and `Dog`.
- [ ] Animal object has the correct `name` property.
